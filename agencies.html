  <h1>Voice Search Marketing Agencies</h1>

    <p>Voice search marketing is still a young discipline and many businesses have yet to prioritise the optimization of their websites and apps for Voice Search. The specialized knowledge is still being developed in marketing departments as the big tech companies roll out updates (some behind the scenes) to how their voice search algorhythms function. People have years of background <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> knowledge which largely kept its utility during the redistribution of search share towards mobile happened over the last few years. But voice search is a very different interface for using tech. Typically only one result will be delivered. How will your business be that one result if you do not have the resources to face the problem?

Luckily there are many marketing agencies around who have to remain up to date with all developments in the search marketing world. If it's a decent agency, then at least one person will have been tasked with handling voice search marketing for their clients. Some of these agencies will be better than others as in all fields, so how do you find one that can help your business take advantage of the coming of voice search?

Tip one is to try voice searching yourself with your target search terms and see what the competition has been up to. If you find a competitor who is consistently coming out as the unique search result for a voice query, then do a little investigating and find out who helped them to that profitable position. More than likely it was a marketing agency with specialized voice search knowledge.</p>
