  <h1>Voice Search Marketing Strategy</h1>

    <p>It is not good enough to directly port over your existing search strategy. For one thing, there may be only one result for any given search. If you're not prepared to put in the work and money to be first for your usual target search queries, then you will need to develop a new strategy for voice search.
Just as the move from desktop to mobile impacted how and when people searched, the move to voice search on mobile, and increasingly on home assistants will have a similar impact. As this new technology changes rapidly with new devices and contexts emerging all the time, you will need to be on top of how these changes relate to your business and consequently how to develop a voice search strategy that keeps delivering on your KPIs. With voice search being a comparetively new technology, now is the ideal time to get ahead of your competitors and dminate those top spots in the results.
The nature of your business will strongly impact how you face up to voice searches. People are still not using voice search to research complex products or to compare many differnt options before purchasing. Many voice searches on mobile have a very local intent, such as "where is a nearby bar open now". Home assistant searches may be more informational or oriented towards leisure activities, bearing in mind that an assistant is often a shared device. These new ways of using search with a voice interface also opens up opportunities to provide an enhanced customer experience. After all, using voice search is supposed to be easier for people, so why shouldn't the resulting feedback from your company be better for them than a traditional text search results page? Creative companies and marketers will get the jump on their competitors.
For some ideas, take a look here at some voice search marketing examples</p>
